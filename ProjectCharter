Project Charter

Problem Statement: Our mission is to connect the people who desire to give back to the community with the organizations looking for help. There is an inexplicable miscommunication between the two groups and we are bridging the gap with a state of the art app and support system. Our app will improve upon the existing solutions by providing a method for users to track hours spent volunteering and for organizations to endorse events created by others. Our app beats the competition by adding more connecting features such as better tracking among organizations and easily sharing events.

Project Objectives: 
Build an Android app that allows community service leaders to create events which anyone can easily find and join
Create a database of events and users that the app can connect to 
Create a login system that allows users to track hours worked, join events, create events, and follow groups
Design a feed of events from groups that users follow
Build a system that allows users to automatically check in and record hours at events
Implement a way for organizations to endorse events created by other organizations

Stakeholders: 
Customers/Users: Organizations looking to increase involvement in their hosted events and volunteers who want to serve more in their community.
